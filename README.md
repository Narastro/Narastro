### 👋 Hello! My name is hanbyeol Jo, I'm dreaming of becoming a developer.

📚My major is Electrical and electronic engineering, 💻and I have been studying computer science since 2021. I can Python(My most confident language) and Javascript. I am especially interested in web-frontend. Today as well, I am eager to achieve my dream by solving algorithm problems.
